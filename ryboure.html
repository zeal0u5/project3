  <h1>The Ryboure Campaign</h1>
    <div id="summary">
      <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>This is a DND 5th Edition homebrew campaign. The main story is within the city limits of Ryboure, a hustling city ready for any innovation or learning. The party consists of a rag tag group of things that met by chance and now adventure together. They have fought off amorphous blood monsters, thiefs, horses, a floating skull and many more. Their journey continues while trying to infiltrate Arch Mage Marcine's office because she has tried to murder us at least twice. Our plan: have one player, Ogan, wild shape into a spider and speak in while another player, Lizee, sees and hears what Ogan is doing in order to make a plan to steal information.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="player">
      <h2>Players</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Nahran Umbra is a Githzerai Monk from Lathander's Light Monastary. He was brought there at a young age and was taught under Ryo. Nahran channels his ki into an astral body and arms. </li>
        <li>Sherrington (Sherry) Farehaven is a Harengon Artificer. She was found on an island alone with no memory by a group of pirates and was told to work on the ship. Once tired of that, she headed to Ryboure to find a new goal in life.</li>
        <li>Ogan The Flameshell is a Tortle Wildfire Druid that is many centuries old. He is a slow and sometimes knowledgeable old man. He can communicate and shapeshift into animals. He has claimed Lizee and Nahran as his adopted children.</li>
        <li>Serinus (Serin) Alder Catiline of Nephrite is a Drow Warlock from Nephrite, a city many leagues away. He wears a ring that condenses his powers that he got by making a deal with shadow demons. He carries around a tome and acts like a rich kid.</li>
        <li>Lizee is a Human Ranger that keeps racoon spirits under her dress. She is very strong and fights with a greatsword. The racoons help her scout out areas and get more information, while sometimes fighting things.</li>
        <li>Armageddon: One of Lizee's raccoons.</li>
        <li>Calamity: One of Lizee's raccoons.</li>
        <li>Chongles: One of Lizee's raccoons.</li>
        <li>Devastation: One of Lizee's raccoons.</li>

    <h2>Location Information</h2>
      <p>The main part of the city is located within the Erathis Band. This is where most people live, where the city is booming, and where all of the neighborhoods lie. For example, Consortia Arcanum is located in the Vanguard neighborhoods with all of the military institutions as well. More inwards is the Gilded Strip. This is where much of the city's richest people live. This band shields the light from going into the center of the city, called the depths, as much as possible. The depths is a giant hole in the center of the city. It holds all of the nocturnal races and caves. On the outskirts of the city is the Kessig's Tend. This is where all of the food is grown for the entire city. Through druidic magic, once a year everyone comes together to make the next years magical harvest successful. Outside of the Tend is the Kessig expanse. This is mostly plains with scaterings of forests. </p>

  </div>
  <div id="politics">
    <h2>Politics</h2>
      <h3>The Assembly</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The Assembly is a group of politicians, local leaders, guild representatives, religious leaders, and other figures of import. The goal of the assembly is to represent all the peoples of Ryboure, but it too is not untouched by corruption. </li>
        <li>It keeps The Regency in check.</li>
        <li>Representatives serve for life, or until their constituency is ruled to no longer have enough influence or stake for a representative, in which case their seat is removed, or their constituency sees fit to replace them</li>
        <li>Currently there are 380 members of the assembly, with plans to add more in 6 months. </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>The Regency</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The Regency is headed by one member of the 5 original families.</li>
        <li>The families take turns for the 7 year regency and their centuries long alliances, deals, and subterfuge keep each other in check, and when that does not, The Assembly has the power to intervene.</li>
        <li>The families include: Enbergleam, Bronzefordge, Ark'Thrun, Flowvel, and Reyelli.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Hands of the Regent</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The police/law enforcers of the reigon. They are followers of the Lawbearer, giving the Church a pseudo-direct control over law enforcement.</li>
      </ul>
  </div>
  <div id="religion">
    <h2>Religion</h2>
      <h3>Church of Erathis</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The predominant religious faction by far, the Church of Erathis is headed by members of the Reyelli family</li>
        <li>Nearly 80% of people within the city subscribe to the ideals or institution of Erathis on various levels.</li>
        <li>They oversee all matters of law and civilization, which gives them a free reign to take a part in most all things happening in the city.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Lathander's Light Monestary</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>A small faction, with two branches in the band itself, Lathander’s Light maintains a devout, small, and somewhat understated following.</li>
        <li>Lathander’s Light focuses on preserving their traditions and teachings, and their one assembly member, Adrus Cinber, doesn’t make a habit of drawing the ire of other factions.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Changebringer's Following</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Representing those who wish to live freely, put their lives in the balance of chance, or who just believe in the luck brought by the Changebringer, many who follow Avandra live unpredictable lives.</li>
        <li>Does not have official representives in The Assembly or an official temple</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Moridin's Health</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>With 6 temples around the city, Moridin’s following is heavily skewed towards artisans, crafters, and even some inventors. </li>
        <li>Brings 8 representitives to The Assembly with their political ties closely related to most guilds, only breaking from economic allegiance on matters of religious nature..</li>
      </ul>
